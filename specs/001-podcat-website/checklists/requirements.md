# Specification Quality Checklist: Podcat 播客網站

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Specification contains no framework-specific details (React, Vue, etc.), no database mentions, no API implementation details. Content is entirely user-focused.

✅ **PASS**: All sections focus on what users need (browse episodes, understand the podcast, find answers) without mentioning how to build it.

✅ **PASS**: Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders - uses terms like "modern design", "user-friendly", "visual hierarchy" rather than technical jargon.

✅ **PASS**: All mandatory sections completed: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria. Key Entities included as feature involves data.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **PASS**: All requirements are testable. Examples:
- FR-001: Can verify 4 pages exist
- FR-004: Can count 20 episode items and verify each has title/date/description
- FR-012: Can test with WCAG validation tools
- FR-017: Can verify FAQ accordion interaction

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: "30 seconds" - specific time
- SC-003: "≥ 4/5" - specific rating
- SC-005: "≥ 90" - specific score
- SC-008: "< 200ms" - specific performance metric

✅ **PASS**: Success criteria avoid implementation details:
- Uses "users see results" not "API response time"
- Uses "Lighthouse score" not "React rendering performance"
- Uses user-facing metrics throughout

✅ **PASS**: All 3 user stories have acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format. Each scenario is specific and testable.

✅ **PASS**: Edge cases identified for:
- Narrow screens (<320px)
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen readers
- Missing data
- Browser compatibility
- Slow loading

✅ **PASS**: Scope clearly bounded:
- 4 specific pages only
- 20 episode items (static data)
- No audio playback functionality
- No external platform integration
- No contact forms (only email display)

✅ **PASS**: Assumptions section documents 10 specific assumptions about undefined aspects (navigation style, FAQ interaction pattern, content length, etc.)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 to FR-017) can be verified through user stories:
- FR-001-003: Covered in User Story 1
- FR-006: Covered in User Story 2
- FR-007, FR-017: Covered in User Story 3
- FR-008-016: Cross-cutting concerns verifiable in all stories

✅ **PASS**: User scenarios cover:
- Primary flow: Discovering episodes (P1)
- Secondary flow: Learning about podcast (P2)
- Tertiary flow: Getting questions answered (P3)

✅ **PASS**: 10 measurable success criteria defined that align with the 3 user stories and functional requirements.

✅ **PASS**: Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout. Even design requirements (FR-009) describe desired outcomes ("modern typography", "appealing color scheme") not specific tools.

## Notes

All validation checks passed successfully. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user scenarios with clear priorities
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Strong accessibility requirements aligned with constitution
- Clear assumptions documented for all ambiguous areas
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused

**No issues found** - Specification meets all quality standards.
